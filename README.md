This is a project made as a test challenge for ST

# Getting Started
- `make configure`
- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run`

## Development

Since this project uses packages for code generation, build_runner should be executed. To simplify
this process, `make` provides a short way to call `flutter pub run build_runner build`

- `make build` - run code generator once
- `make watch` - run code generator and watch for changes
- `make test` - run tests
